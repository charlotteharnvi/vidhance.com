>Anyone who has ever taken a handheld video knows that medium's Achillesâ€™ heel: No matter how hard you try to hold your hand still, the frame shakes and pitches and generally nauseates anyone who tries to watch it.

Vidhance Live Video stabilization is the first feature within the Vidhance platform brought to market. Tests with leading smartphones demonstrate that low-frequency wobbling motion is still a challenge, resulting in unstable, low-quality videos. By utilizing both data from gyro sensors, as well as performing optical analysis, users can now reach new, professional levels

>I thought that all smartphones already had image stabilization.
