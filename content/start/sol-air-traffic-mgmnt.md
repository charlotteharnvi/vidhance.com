# Air Traffic Management

Air traffic control is more reliant on video than ever, and airports see more and more cameras being installed not only for traffic control, but also for security and perimeter protection purposes. However, weather and video visibility are not always favorable. VidhanceÂ® improves the video feed received at the remote traffic control by addressing weather effects such as fog, mist, uneven illumination etc. It also provides object tracking and other video analytic functions.
