# Vidhance integration

Vidhance Mobile is an intelligent software layer which can be added to the phone's operating system, giving the smartphone a clear edge in camera capabilities and providing all applications with a smooth video experience. The software is implemented as a wrapper around the driver that implements the Camera HAL, causing minimal disruption to lower and higher levels in the image pipe. For additional performance gains, a deeper integration, closer to camera hardware, is also possible.
